Autonomous Mars Base Architecture - Multi-Agent AI Design Study

# 🚀 PROJECT VANGUARD
**Autonomous Mars Base Architecture — Zero-Risk Human Presence**

> A multi-agent systems design study exploring critical infrastructure under extreme constraints.  
> Developed using a multi-model red-team/blue-team review loop (ChatGPT ↔ Gemini) with human-in-the-loop validation.

## Scope & Claims
Project Vanguard is a systems engineering architecture with certification logic (Claim → Requirement → Test → Evidence → Gate).  
It combines standardizable engineering components (redundancy, DC microgrid, fault isolation, habitat segmentation, safety-critical OS policy)  
with a hypothesis-driven energy assumption (DS-Core reservoir coupling) handled via falsifiable experiments and Go/No-Go envelopes.

## 🎯 Core Doctrine

**Humans only enter when the base is verified, not when it's "good enough".**

### Key Systems:
- **DS-CORE**: 20-module energy fortress with <5µs fault isolation
- **THE HIVE**: Hexagonal buried habitat ("concrete outside, spacecraft inside")  
- **BIO-DOME**: Central agricultural + psychological stability zone (P2 priority)
- **HEA Protocol**: Measurable validation gates (HV-0 through HV-5)
