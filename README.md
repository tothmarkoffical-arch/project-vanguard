Autonomous Mars Base Architecture - Multi-Agent AI Design Study

# 🚀 PROJECT VANGUARD
**Autonomous Mars Base Architecture — Zero-Risk Human Presence**

> A multi-agent AI design study exploring critical infrastructure under extreme constraints.
> Developed through adversarial collaboration between ChatGPT and Gemini.

## 🎯 Core Doctrine

**Humans only enter when the base is verified, not when it's "good enough".**

### Key Systems:
- **DS-CORE**: 20-module energy fortress with <5µs fault isolation
- **THE HIVE**: Hexagonal buried habitat ("concrete outside, spacecraft inside")  
- **BIO-DOME**: Central agricultural + psychological stability zone (P2 priority)
- **HEA Protocol**: Measurable validation gates (HV-0 through HV-5)

## 📄 Documentation

**Full white paper coming soon.**

This project demonstrates Human-AI orchestration for complex systems design:
- ✓ Adversarial iteration (ChatGPT ↔ Gemini)
- ✓ RLAIF principles (Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback)
- ✓ Fault-tree-driven architecture
- ✓ Human-in-the-Loop validation
